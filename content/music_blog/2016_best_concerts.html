                    What fun is it to read about concerts without getting a feel for the music? I've attached a curated
                    playlist to go with the review. I've also attached plenty of YouTube videos if you don't have

                    Ardmore Music Hall (AMH) pulled off my favorite music festival experience to date. Live from the Lot is a
                    celebration of jazz, funk and blues and can be best described as New Orleans with the homeliness of
                    Philly. AMH is one of my favorite venues thanks to their expertly curated billing. I loved how
                    all the various artists joined in to jam with others throughout the festival!
                    <br><br>

                    Live from the Lot is a cozy two-day outdoor festival set up at the parking lot of the Ardmore Music Hall, in the
                    Philadelphia suburb of Ardmore. Thanks to heavy rain on the first day, there were concerns on whether the
                    festival would actually go through. I learned later through a friend working at the AMH that after a last
                    ditch struggle, the crew was able to move the festival to the Electric Factory,
                    located close to the heart of Philadelphia.
                    <br><br>

                    After making it through to the Electric Factory, I was greeted by the sounds of the Brooklyn-based
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ef93xLBFyI">Pimps of Joytime</a>.
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/oEU2AiIbmr4?t=2m18s">Charlie Hunter</a> is a very talented musician, and
                    he plays bass and guitar on the same instrument, and at the same time! Next up was
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/1C7-da67TQk?t=10s"> Foundations of Funk</a>, a supergroup consisting of George Porter (bass) & Zigaboo Modeliste (drums)
                    from The Meters and Neil Evans (keyboards) & Eric Krasno (guitar) from Soulive.
                    . For the unacquainted,  <b>The Meters</b> are the godfathers of funk.
                    Foundations of Funk delivered the grooviest set of the night.<br><br>

                    Earlier in the year, I learned about the New Orleans-based <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BevRLsk816A">The Revivalists</a> and they do a
                    great job at combining soul and rock. <br><br>

                    The headliners? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0WRHV_vt8">Snarky Puppy</a>. For those who have had the opportunity to listen to their music, they are truly
                    an experience. Led by bandleader extraordinaire, Michael League, Snarky Puppy is a musical collective with
                    a rotating ensemble of musicians with frightening abilities.

                    I had to dedicate two separate entries to Live from the Lot as the two days were equally enjoyable
                    and also different. The second day of the festival was glorious with the clear skies, 70F/21C
                    weather and <a href="http://www.tiredhands.com/cafe">Tired Hands</a> next door. <br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdHyVul4Ld4">Darla</a> opened the second day's festivities. I have a soft spot for Darla. Not only are they
                    incredible musicians, but they also started off playing in basement house shows in Philly, and
                    were frankly one of the few acts that I cared for at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6SCVxDYUHy8?t=28m4s">Snarky Puppy</a> played a second
                    set, and I was just as amazed by their set the second time around. <br><br>

                    I then had my first introduction to <a href="https://youtu.be/dbyO5ni9jxg?t=18m27s">Swift Technique</a>, and you'll read more about them soon. The
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yo3IWVamXl0?t=2m25s">High and Mighty Brass Band</a> allows the crowd to join in the fun, and give you a little taste for
                    New Orleans! Day Two's headliner was <a href="https://youtu.be/k1SjiOh5IcQ?t=15m33s">Soulive</a>, a very soulful (sorry) funk/jazz trio consisting of
                    prolific musicians Eric Krasno (guitar), Neal Evans (organ) and Alan Evans (drums).

                New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
                </h4>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                    New Orleans is a magical place. After visiting New Orleans in 2015 and falling
                    in love with jazz, I knew that my return to the Big Easy was a matter of time. Jazzfest is
                    a great opportunity to dig into the music and food of New Orleans. <br><br>

                    Admittedly, I haven't heard much of Prince's music. However, I came to realize just how strongly
                    Prince impacted the music community as most artists paid tribute to him after his untimely passing
                    the day before Jazzfest. Just hours after learning about his death,
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/4WtmkES0X48?t=34s">Kermit Ruffins</a> put on a great
                    tribute at a pre-Jazzfest free concert at the Louis Armstrong park. <br><br>

                    I'll one day write a proper account of my experiences in New Orleans, but for the sake of brevity,
                    I'll focus on the highlights.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRDZCd1LiGU">Steely Dan</a> has played a strong role in my life and I was
                    thoroughly overjoyed to see them headline what was a truly magical first day. <br><br>

                    I was pleasantly surprised by the sets put on by
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIBtdbDCIFM>">Grace Potter</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLtsfafBjCY">Maxwell</a>, as I didn't really know
                    anything about them and they owned the crowd.

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJRO2Nh4uHY">RHCP</a> is another
                    band that I've always wanted to see and the energy that they have easily transferred over to the
                    80-100,000 or so people who were at the main stage. I might've underestimated the size of the crowd.
                    Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS9KzmXzfn8">drone footage</a>!

                    <a href="https://youtu.be/C3uIpAMoZlw?t=57m10s">The Motet</a> is an incredible high-energy funk/jam band group from Denver, CO. When I first read that
                    the group was performing at the Ardmore Music Hall, I got the impression that they were a little
                    too big for the venue. Now don't get me wrong, Ardmore Music Hall is my favorite music venue, with it's
                    intimate setting and musically educated audience. However, The Motet sold out their show(s) at the
                    Red Rocks amphitheater months ago and were soon going to be performing at AMH. <br><br>
                    I wasn't wrong! The venue was jam-packed and it was incredible seeing such a great band perform
                    in what is comparatively a small venue. I could see The Motet selling out at the Fillmore in 2017,
                    so I'm lucky to see them in close quarters.

                    at Austin City Limits Live, I had the opportunity to see this truly glorious ensemble of musicians at the Keswick Theatre in Glenside, PA. The Keswick is
                    a large, seated venue in the suburbs of Philadelphia, typically attracting a mature fanbase and more established
                    artists. Susan Tedeschi and her husband Derek Trucks have put together a musical collective that will
                    surely go down the annals of history. It was incredible hearing Tedeschi's voice fill up the Keswick,
                    accompanied by Trucks' slide guitar virtuosity, the very soulful gospel choir, energetic horn section,
                    two drummers and the ever-present Kofi Burbridge.

                    I'm honored to have gifted musicians in my family, Bharath (brother) and Sneha (sister-in-law), to
                    whom I credit a lot of my tastes and preferences.
                    When Sneha told me about a band that would be performing in Philly in August, I blindly bought tickets
                    immediately, which was a good call since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J_tuKh55d4">
                    Hiatus Kaiyote's</a> show at the Trocadero Theatre sold out. In all
                    my years in Philly, I've never seen a show at the Troc sell out. They weren't lying about the
                    catchphrase; Multi-Dimensional, Polyrhythmic, Gangster Shit. Throw in a charismatic frontwoman with
                    a good amount of funk and time signatures that my simple brain can't comprehend, and you get one of the
                    most talented groups around today.

                    I learned about <a href="https://youtu.be/IxVUwtMEvqs?t=13m57s">Swift Technique</a>
                    at Live from the Lot, and they very quickly have become my favorite
                    Philadelphia-based music group. Channeling the spirit of New Orleans and the no-f*!@ks-given Philly
                    attitude, Swift Technique is a very, very fun band to see live. ST has the uncanny ability of
                    making the most stiff and stoic of individuals groove out, and I really hope they make it big. Props
                    to Con Brio from San Francisco, for a great opening set.

                   You've surely heard of George Clinton's music. A jam-packed Ardmore Music Hall was ready for a night of
                    P-funk, but was greeted to a bare-bone heavy metal band, that was eventually joined by two rappers.
                    Wow, not quite what I expected from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHj7v8rKogg&feature=youtu.be&t=1m35s">
                    George Clinton</a> show. Soon, we were joined by a gospel choir,
                    the horn section and the man himself, George Clinton, who's relegated himself to primarily a cheerleader role
                    but no doubt orchestrated the entire performance. If you get a chance, you should definitely see this
                    act.

                    A couple of weeks after seeing one of the best performances I've ever seen, at Live from the Lot,
                    I decided that I needed more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH02pMfZO3g">Snarky Puppy
                    </a>in my life. What better way to spend New Year's Eve than
                    to see one of your favorite music acts in New York City?! I was accompanied by my friend Harsha,
                    who flew in from London right when the doors opened! Yeah, he had a very exciting 24 hours. <br><br>

                    Opening for the Pups was the phenomenal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftC-dyvSTFU">
                    Banda Magda</a>. It's unfortunate that I missed a good chunk of
                    their set, but I look forward to seeing them at the Groundup Music Festival.

                    Earlier this year, Youtube recommended a few videos by slide guitar player called Roosevelt Collier,
                    which I quite enjoyed. My decision to see him perform was fairly simple as those "friends" were
                    Eli Winderman (keyboards) and Rob Compa (guitar/vocal) from Dopapod, Mike Greenfield
                    , the drummer for Lotus, and Michael League, the bandleader of
                    Snarky Puppy! There aren't many better things that I can find myself spending an evening than
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/wESLwnU14Js?t=36m36s"> a couple
                    of hours of improv </a> by world class musicians at the cozy Ardmore Music Hall.

                    Eric Krasno is one of the most influential musicians in the jam-band, jazz, funk and blues touring
                    circuit of today. I first had the chance to see him with Soulive at Live from the Lot and soon
                    got hooked to all of his other projects. I was surprised to read that he was also involved with the
                    Tedeschi Trucks Band! As a guitar player, Krasno has a unique way of playing as few notes as possible,
                    but with expressiveness bar none. Krasno was surrounded by a great supporting cast and the band
                    is a very tasteful act, although a lot more timid than his other projects.
