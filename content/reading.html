            <p> As a data analyst/scientist who interacts intimately with developers, product owners and UX designers,
                I learned fairly quickly that a general understanding of their craft greatly enhanced our symbiosis.
                A part of the reason I put this website together was to satisfy my curiosity about the various
                components to an application or website, especially the areas that I don't get to dabble
                with professionally. <br><br>

                I found myself in the open source and tech world at the age of 22, right after college. I've had
                multiple people who are interested in breaking into the field reach out to me about the path of
                learning that I am on, and here I am sharing some of the resources that play a
                big role in my continual education. <br><br>
                Disclaimer - As someone working in analytics, I have a bias towards Python.

                    I've learned a lot by following and contributing to technical discussions on Reddit.<br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/"> r/learnpython </a>

                        - Great place to get started if you're new to programming. It helped me a lot when I started
                          out to see what hindrances were faced by fellow beginners, and the best practices suggested by
                          practitioners. <br><br>
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/"> r/Python</a>
                        - Once you feel ready to tackle intermediate problems, it's time to head over to r/Python,
                          which is another really good community. <br><br>


                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flask/"> r/Flask </a>
                        - After you get comfortable with the basics of Python, I'd check out Flask, a micro-framework.
                          Heard of Rails (Ruby) or Django? Flask is a miniature and more of a DIY version of the
                          aforementioned frameworks. Why should you leaarn Flask as a data person?
                          Ever wanted to build a small app that leverages proprietary and/or
                          third-party data, incorporates your modeling and analysis, and showcases results with cool
                          visualizations to the outside world? Flask is your friend.

                    I've had many teachers and mentors that I've never spoken to. Blogs are an incredible medium of
                    communication and I am grateful that there are others out there who share their experiences.

                    As somewhat of a self-taught data guy, Frank Cleary's blog is the most practical and useful resource
                    that I have encountered. There's not much that I can say that does justice to his great work, so
                    check it out for yourselves!

                    This website was created using Hyde, a static website generator. As someone who is by no means a
                    designer or a front-end engineer, following Merlin's blog helped me get started with putting together
                    a decent looking website.

                    - Jeff Knupp's blog is one heck of a resource to learn from about the dark arts of Python. I enjoy
                    the various topics that Jeff touches on and I think that his blog is one of the better things to happen
                    to the Python community. If you consider buying his book - "Writing Idiomatic Python", you
                    won't regret it.

                      Great place to get started if you'd like to listen in on what's going on in the tech community.
                      I love frequenting Hacker News since I get to learn about the challenges faced by practitioners,
                      cool open source projects, the evolving landscape and even just to follow up with commentary on
                      non-tech issues.

                    The weekly newsletter curated by Tristan Handy is a great aggregator for all the happenings in the
                    data science world. Tristan's working on a cool data tool called DBT and also runs an analytics
                    consultancy in Philadelphia called <a href="http://fishtownanalytics.com/">Fishtown Analytics</a>.

                    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/"> Tech Crunch</a>
                    While TechCrunch seems to have gotten a little weak with regard to content, I still like to occasionally
                    browse the TechCrunch website for interesting articles and videos. While I haven't personally used
                    it much, a couple of more tech-business oriented friends of mine swear by Crunchbase.
